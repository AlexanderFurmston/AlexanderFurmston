I have many more projects which I won't give as detailed an explanation of (but feel free to ask me about them). 

**The Welcome System**:  
I made an a computer-vision system in Python, linking up a bread-board, Raspberry Pi, webcam, and LED lights. This system recognises guests (and intruders) entering my house and sets the colour of the lights to match the individual's prefrence (or flashing red for an intruder). Obviously, Raspberry Pis are not particularly powerful, which led to the interesting situation of compiling Python.

**JavaCC Parser**:  
I made a parser for a simple arithmetic programming language using JavaCC. This helped me put my theoretical understanding of parsers and grammars to use and was a really fun project.
