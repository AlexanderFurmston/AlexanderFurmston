For this project, I used Haskell to make an interpreter and compiler for the Scratch programming language. Although most of the work was on the compiler itself, I dabbled in some HTML and Javascript to add some extra features to the frontend.

Graded in the top 10 (of 200 submissions) in my year at university.

I wrote extra unit tests (as an extension) and used functional programming features like: higher order functions, complex
data types, monads, and all the basic Haskell functions
