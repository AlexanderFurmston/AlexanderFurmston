I worked in a team of 7 to develop a prototype website for a mentoring system for Deutsche Bank for a university coursework. I achieved a grade of 76%, above my team's average grade and above the cohort's average grade.

I took on the responsibilities of business analyst, as well as extensive work on the AI system for mentor recommendation. Also, I worked with my team on the ASP.NET backend and helped out with some React frontend development.
