Welcome to my website! I made it using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and the [Terminal](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-terminal/) theme. Here, you can read a bit about me and you can see some examples of some of my programming projects.

I'm currently studying Discrete Maths (Warwick's name for Maths+ComputerSci) at the University of Warwick.
