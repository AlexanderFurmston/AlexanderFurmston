Welcome to my website! I made it using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and the [Terminal](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-terminal/) theme. Here, you can read a bit about me and you can see some examples of some of my programming projects. This website certainly isn't the most advanced web-dev I've done but Hugo is really nice to use and I love the green Terminal theme.

I'm currently studying Discrete Maths (Warwick's name for Maths+ComputerSci) at the University of Warwick. I've just finished 2nd year and I'm hoping for a 1st. Over the summer I am interning at J.P.Morgan where I am using Python, Django, and React to build a system for monitoring databases.
